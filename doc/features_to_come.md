This is to document ideas on what features could/should be implemented.
Features listed are in no particular order.

- uniform storage buffers (aka constant memory)
- uniform/non-uniform images
- dynamic uniforms
- memory pooling
- async data-transfer/execution
- using multiple queues on a single device
- pipelining kernels and data transfers with sync on GPU side
- option to use in no-exception environments
- latency hiding, tiled execution primitives
- header generation from shaders
- better integration/data exchange with graphic pipelines
- compile for CPU-only environments
