# Features To Come
This is to keep track of ideas on what (big) features could/should be implemented (in no particular order).

- uniform storage buffers (aka constant memory)
- uniform/non-uniform images
- dynamic uniforms
- memory pooling
- using multiple queues on a single device
- async data transfers and kernel execution with GPU-side sync
- option to use in no-exception environments
- headers generation from shaders
- better integration/data exchange with graphic pipelines
- compile for no-GPU environments
- Python bindings
