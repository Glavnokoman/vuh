# Asynchronous operations
Thus section describes asynchronous data transfer and kernel execution modes with the host-side synchronization.
It can be used to perform some useful work on the host while waiting for GPU to complete its job.
Another application is overlapping data transfers and computation on GPU.
For the latter interface presented here not optimal since it involves synchronization with the host.

# Synchronization tokens
# Async data transfer
# Async kernel execution
# Overlapping transfer with execution
